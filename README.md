## Notable Projects

### [Video Sync](https://github.com/Brenden-Smith/Video-Sync)
Video Sync is an application created so that users may simultaneously watch YouTube videos with their friends in their own browser. It utilizes React, Node.js, and Google Cloud (Firebase, Cloud Functions, YouTube Data API, YouTube IFrame API) as its stack. I was the sole developer on this project, so I designed and implemented both the front and the back end aspects.
