## Notable Projects
### [Gro](https://github.com/Brenden-Smith/Gro)
Gro is an application that helps users keep track of their plant care needs and journal about their plants. I worked in a team of three to design this for BeachHacks 2021. I built the back-end aspects of this application, such as user authentication and cloud storage, using Firebase. I also implemented the trefle.io API to use as the plant database, and I worked on various front-end aspects with Flutter.

### [Hermes](https://github.com/danieljo09/Hermes)
Hermes is an application that connects students in need of resources to donors willing to provide those resources. I worked in a team of four to design this for the Google DSC Solution Challenge 2021. We primarily used Flutter to design the front-end, and Firebase to do the back-end. I specifically focused on front-end and UI aspects for this project.

### [Journey](https://github.com/Brenden-Smith/Journey)
Winner of MarinaHacksâ€™ Mental Health Category.

Journey is an application designed to help users keep track of their moods and thoughts, while giving them calming music to listen to as well. We designed this app with Flutter, Dart, YouTube API, and Zen Quotes API. Specifically, I did both front and back-end work on this project, including implementing the quotes API and working with the data structures.
