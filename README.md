## Notable Projects
### [Gro](https://github.com/Brenden-Smith/Gro)
Gro is an application that helps users keep track of their plant care needs and journal about their plants. I worked in a team of three to design this for BeachHacks 2021. I built the back-end aspects of this application, such as user authentication and cloud storage, using Firebase. I also implemented the trefle.io API to use as the plant database, and I worked on various front-end aspects with Flutter.

### [Hermes](https://github.com/danieljo09/Hermes)
Hermes is an application that connects students in need of resources to donors willing to provide those resources. I worked in a team of four to design this for the Google DSC Solution Challenge 2021. We primarily used Flutter to design the front-end, and Firebase to do the back-end. I specifically focused on front-end and UI aspects for this project.

### [YouTube Video Sync](https://github.com/Brenden-Smith/YouTube-Video-Sync)
YouTube Video Sync is an application created so that users may simultaneously watch YouTube videos with their friends in their own browser. It utilizes React, Node.js, and Google Cloud (Firebase, Cloud Functions, YouTube Data API, YouTube IFrame API) as its stack. I was the sole developer on this project, so I designed and implemented both the front and the back end aspects.
